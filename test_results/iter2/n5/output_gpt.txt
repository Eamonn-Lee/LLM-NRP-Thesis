To generate a feasible weekly nurse roster, we need to satisfy all hard constraints and aim to minimize the penalties from soft constraint violations. Let's go through each day of the week and assign shifts to nurses, taking into account the given requirements, historical data, and constraints.

### Monday

#### Requirements:
- **Early Shift:**
  - HeadNurse: Minimum 0, Optimal 0
  - Nurse: Minimum 1, Optimal 1
- **Late Shift:**
  - HeadNurse: Minimum 1, Optimal 1
  - Nurse: Minimum 0, Optimal 1
- **Night Shift:**
  - HeadNurse: Minimum 1, Optimal 1
  - Nurse: Minimum 1, Optimal 1

#### Assignments:
1. **Early Shift (Nurse):**
   - Assign **Nguyen** (Nurse skill, FullTime contract) to meet the minimum and optimal requirement.

2. **Late Shift (HeadNurse):**
   - Assign **Andrea** (HeadNurse skill, FullTime contract) to meet the minimum and optimal requirement.

3. **Night Shift (HeadNurse and Nurse):**
   - Assign **Patrick** (HeadNurse and Nurse skills, FullTime contract) to meet both requirements.

#### Evaluation:
- All hard constraints are satisfied.
- No soft constraint violations on Monday.
