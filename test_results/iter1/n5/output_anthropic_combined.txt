I'll solve this nurse rostering problem step by step, considering all hard and soft constraints.

## Initial Analysis

**Nurses and their status at week start:**
- **Patrick** (FullTime, HeadNurse+Nurse): Worked Night shift, 4 consecutive working days, needs day off
- **Andrea** (FullTime, HeadNurse+Nurse): Worked Early shifts for 3 days, can continue
- **Stefaan** (PartTime, HeadNurse+Nurse): 3 consecutive days off, can work
- **Sara** (PartTime, Nurse only): Worked Late shift, 4 consecutive working days, needs day off
- **Nguyen** (FullTime, Nurse only): 1 day off, can work

**Key constraints to consider:**
- Patrick needs minimum 2 consecutive days off (has 0)
- Sara needs minimum 3 consecutive days off (has 0) 
- Night shift requires 4-5 consecutive assignments
- Complete weekends required for all nurses
