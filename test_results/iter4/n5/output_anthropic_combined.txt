I'll solve this nurse rostering problem step by step, considering all hard and soft constraints.

**Initial Analysis:**

**Nurses and their current states:**
- Patrick (FullTime, HeadNurse+Nurse): Coming from 4 consecutive working days, last worked Night shift
- Andrea (FullTime, HeadNurse+Nurse): Coming from 3 consecutive working days, last worked Early shift, requested Tuesday off
- Stefaan (PartTime, HeadNurse+Nurse): Coming from 3 consecutive days off, requested Wednesday off
- Sara (PartTime, Nurse only): Coming from 4 consecutive working days, last worked Late shift, requested Late Saturday off
- Nguyen (FullTime, Nurse only): Coming from 1 day off, requested Friday and Saturday off

**Key constraints to consider:**
- Shift successions: Night→Early/Late forbidden, Late→Early forbidden
- Consecutive shifts: Early(2-5), Late(2-3), Night(4-5)
- Consecutive working days: FullTime(3-5), PartTime(3-5)
- Consecutive days off: FullTime(2-3), PartTime(3-5)
- Complete weekends required for all contracts

Let me work through each day:

**MONDAY:**
Requirements:
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

Constraints check:
- Patrick: Can only do Night (coming from Night shift)
- Andrea: Can do any shift (coming from Early)
- Stefaan: Can do any shift (coming from days off)
- Sara: Can only do Late or Night (coming from Late)
- Nguyen: Can do any shift (coming from day off)

Assignments:
- Patrick: Night (continues Night, HeadNurse requirement)
- Andrea: Early (Nurse requirement)
- Stefaan: Late (HeadNurse requirement)
- Sara: OFF (needs rest after 4 consecutive days)
- Nguyen: Night (Nurse requirement)

Missing optimal: Late-Nurse (Weight: 30)
**Running penalty: 30**

**TUESDAY:**
Requirements:
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

Constraints check:
- Patrick: Worked Night Monday (at 5 consecutive working days - must rest)
- Andrea: Requested OFF
- Stefaan: Worked Late Monday
- Sara: Day off #1
- Nguyen: Worked Night Monday

Assignments:
- Patrick: OFF (exceeds max consecutive working days)
- Andrea: OFF (requested)
- Stefaan: Late (continues, min 2 consecutive)
- Sara: OFF (continues days off, PartTime needs min 3)
- Nguyen: Night (continues, min 4 consecutive)

Problem: No one for Early! This violates hard constraint. Must revise:

- Patrick: OFF
- Andrea: OFF (requested)
- Stefaan: Early (breaks Late sequence, penalty for breaking min consecutive)
- Sara: Late (breaks days off early)
- Nguyen: Night

Penalties: 
- Stefaan breaks Late min consecutive (1 day short): Weight 15
- Sara breaks min consecutive days off (2 days short): Weight 60

**Running penalty: 30 + 15 + 60 = 105**

**WEDNESDAY:**
Requirements:
- Early: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)

Constraints check:
- Patrick: Day off #1
- Andrea: Day off #1
- Stefaan: Requested OFF, worked Early Tuesday
- Sara: Worked Late Tuesday
- Nguyen: 2 consecutive Night shifts

Assignments:
- Patrick: Early (HeadNurse requirement)
- Andrea: Night (HeadNurse requirement)
- Stefaan: OFF (requested)
- Sara: Late (continues, min 2)
- Nguyen: Night (continues)

Missing optimal: Early-Nurse, Night-Nurse (Weight: 60)
**Running penalty: 105 + 60 = 165**

**THURSDAY:**
Requirements:
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

Constraints check:

- Andrea: Worked Night Wednesday
- Stefaan: Day off #1
- Sara: 2 consecutive Late shifts
- Nguyen: 3 consecutive Night shifts

Assignments:
- Patrick: Early (continues, min 2)
- Andrea: Night (continues, min 4)
- Stefaan: Night (HeadNurse requirement for 2nd Night slot)
- Sara: Late (can do 3rd consecutive)
- Nguyen: Night (continues)

All requirements met optimally!
**Running penalty: 165**

**FRIDAY:**
Requirements:
- Early: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)

- Sara: Late (breaks days off early)
- Nguyen: Night

Penalties: 
- Stefaan breaks Late min consecutive (1 day short): Weight 15

Constraints check:
- Patrick: 2 consecutive Early shifts

Assignments:
- Patrick: Early (continues, HeadNurse requirement)
- Andrea: Night (continues)

Problem: No one for Late minimum! Must revise:
- Patrick: Early (HeadNurse requirement)
- Andrea: Late (breaks Night sequence early)
- Stefaan: Night (continues)
- Sara: OFF
- Nguyen: OFF (requested)

Penalties:
- Andrea breaks Night min consecutive (2 days short): Weight 30
- Missing optimal: Early-Nurse, Night-Nurse (Weight: 60)

**Running penalty: 165 + 30 + 60 = 255**

**SATURDAY-SUNDAY (Weekend planning together due to complete weekend constraint):**

Saturday Requirements:
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

Sunday Requirements:
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

Current state entering weekend:
- Patrick: 3 consecutive Early shifts, 4 working days this week
- Andrea: 1 Late shift, 4 working days this week
- Stefaan: 2 consecutive Night shifts, 3 working days this week
- Sara: 1 day off, 3 working days this week, requested Late Saturday off
- Nguyen: 1 day off, 3 working days this week, requested Saturday off

Complete weekend constraint means nurses work both days or neither.

Options:
1. Patrick: Both days OFF (already worked 4 days)
2. Andrea: Both days working (can do Late both days for HeadNurse requirement)
3. Stefaan: Both days working (continue Night)
4. Sara: Both days OFF (requested Saturday Late off, only 3 days worked)
5. Nguyen: Both days OFF (requested Saturday off)

This leaves us short on coverage. Let's revise:

**SATURDAY:**
- Patrick: OFF
- Andrea: Late (HeadNurse requirement)
- Stefaan: Night (continues, satisfies N
- Stefaan: Night (continues)
- Sara: OFF
- Nguyen: OFF (requested)

Penalties:
- Andrea breaks Night min consecutive (2 days short): Weight 30
- Missing optimal: Early-Nurse, Night-Nurse (Weight: 60)

**Running penalty: 165 + 30 + 60 = 255**

**SATURDAY-SUNDAY (Weekend planning together due to complete weekend constraint):**

Saturday Requirements:
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

Sunday Requirements:
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

Current state entering weekend:
- Patrick: 3 consecutive Early shifts, 4 working days this week
- Andrea: 1 Late shift, 4 working days this week
- Stefaan: 2 consecutive Night shifts, 3 working days this week
- Sara: 1 day off, 3 working days this week, requested Late Saturday off
- Nguyen: 1 day off, 3 working days this week, requested Saturday off

Complete weekend constraint means nurses work both days or neither.

Options:
1. Patrick: Both days OFF (already worked 4 days)
2. Andrea: Both days working (can do Late both days for HeadNurse requirement)
3. Stefaan: Both days working (continue Night)
4. Sara: Both days OFF (requested Saturday Late off, only 3 days worked)
5. Nguyen: Both days OFF (requested Saturday off)

This leaves us short on coverage. Let's revise:

**SATURDAY:**
- Patrick: OFF
- Andrea: Late (HeadNurse requirement)
- Stefaan: Night (continues, satisfies Nurse requirement)
- Sara: Early (works weekend, avoids Late as requested)
- Nguyen: OFF (requested)

Missing optimal: Late-Nurse (Weight: 30)

**SUNDAY:**
- Patrick: OFF (complete weekend)
- Andrea: Late (complete weekend, HeadNurse requirement)
- Stefaan: Night (complete weekend, satisfies Nurse requirement)
- Sara: Early (complete weekend)
- Nguyen: OFF (complete weekend)

Missing optimal: Late-Nurse (Weight: 30)

**Running penalty: 255 + 30 + 30 = 315**
