### Summary

This roster satisfies all hard constraints and aims to minimize penalties from soft constraints. The assignments respect the minimum and optimal requirements, avoid forbidden successions, and consider shift off requests. The consecutive working days and days off constraints are respected, and the total assignments are within the limits of each nurse's contract. The complete weekend constraint is also considered by ensuring that nurses with this requirement either work both days or none. The penalties from soft constraints are minimized by meeting optimal staffing levels as closely as possible.
