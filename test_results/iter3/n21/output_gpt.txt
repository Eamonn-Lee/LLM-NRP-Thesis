### Summary

This roster satisfies all hard constraints:
1. Each nurse is assigned to at most one shift per day.
2. All shifts meet the minimum staffing requirements.
3. Legal shift successions are maintained.
4. Nurses are assigned to shifts they are qualified for.

Soft constraints are minimized by:
- Ensuring optimal staffing where possible.
- Maintaining consecutive assignments and days off within contract limits.
- Respecting shift-off requests to minimize preference penalties.
- Ensuring complete weekends for nurses with such requirements.

This roster provides a balanced schedule while minimizing penalties from soft constraint violations.
