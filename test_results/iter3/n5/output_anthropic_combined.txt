I'll solve this nurse rostering problem step by step, considering all hard and soft constraints.

## Initial Analysis

**Nurses and their constraints:**
- Patrick (FullTime): HeadNurse + Nurse skills, currently on Night shift (1 consecutive), 4 consecutive working days
- Andrea (FullTime): HeadNurse + Nurse skills, currently on Early shift (3 consecutive), 3 consecutive working days, has Tuesday off request
- Stefaan (PartTime): HeadNurse + Nurse skills, 3 consecutive days off, has Wednesday off request
- Sara (PartTime): Nurse skill only, currently on Late shift (1 consecutive), 4 consecutive working days, has Late Saturday off request
- Nguyen (FullTime): Nurse skill only, 1 consecutive day off, has Friday and Saturday off requests

**Key constraints to consider:**
- Shift successions: Night → cannot do Early/Late next day; Late → cannot do Early next day
- Consecutive shift limits: Early (2-5), Late (2-3), Night (4-5)
- Working days: FullTime (3-5 consecutive), PartTime (3-5 consecutive)
- Days off: FullTime (2-3 consecutive), PartTime (3-5 consecutive)
- Complete weekends for all nurses

## Day-by-Day Rostering

### Monday
**Requirements:**
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

**Analysis:**
- Patrick: On Night shift, can only continue Night (succession constraint)
- Andrea: On Early shift (3 consecutive), can continue Early or switch to Late/Night
- Stefaan: Was off (3 days), can start any shift
- Sara: On Late shift (1 consecutive), must continue Late (minimum 2)
- Nguyen: Was off (1 day), needs another day off (minimum 2 consecutive)

**Assignments:**
- Night: Patrick (HeadNurse) - continues Night shift
- Late: Sara (Nurse) - continues Late shift (day 2)
- Late: Andrea (HeadNurse) - switches from Early to Late
- Early: Stefaan (Nurse) - starts working

### Tuesday
**Requirements:**
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

**Analysis:**
- Patrick: Night shift (2 consecutive), must continue Night
- Andrea: Has off request - must be off
- Stefaan: Early shift (1 consecutive), must continue Early (minimum 2)
- Sara: Late shift (2 consecutive), can continue or stop
- Nguyen: Off (2 consecutive days), can work or continue off

**Assignments:**
- Off: Andrea (requested)
- Night: Patrick (Nurse) - continues Night (day 3)
- Early: Stefaan (Nurse) - continues Early (day 2)
- Late: Sara (Nurse) - continues Late (day 3, then must stop)
- Off: Nguyen - continues off (day 3)

### Wednesday
**Requirements:**
- Early: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)

**Analysis:**
- Patrick: Night shift (3 consecutive), must continue Night (minimum 4)
- Andrea: Was off (1 day), needs another day off (minimum 2)
- Stefaan: Has off request - must be off
- Sara: Late shift (3 consecutive), reached maximum - must be off
- Nguyen: Off (3 consecutive), can start working

**Assignments:**
- Off: Stefaan (requested)
- Off: Andrea - continues off (day 2)
- Off: Sara - after 3 Late shifts
- Night: Patrick (HeadNurse) - continues Night (day 4)
- Early: Nguyen (Nurse) - starts working but creates 30 penalty (missing HeadNurse for Early)

**Note:** We have a staffing issue here. We need a HeadNurse for Early but Patrick is on Night. This creates a 30-point penalty.

### Thursday
**Requirements:**
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

**Analysis:**
- Patrick: Night shift (4 consecutive), can continue or stop
- Andrea: Off (2 consecutive), can start working
- Stefaan: Was off (1 day), needs another day off (minimum 2 for PartTime is 3)
- Sara: Off (1 day), needs more days off (minimum 3 for PartTime)
- Nguyen: Early shift (1 consecutive), must continue Early (minimum 2)

**Assignments:**
- Off: Stefaan - continues off (day 2)
- Off: Sara - continues off (day 2)
- Night: Patrick (HeadNurse) - continues Night (day 5, then must stop)
- Early: Nguyen (Nurse) - continues Early (day 2)
- Late: Andrea (Nurse) - starts working

### Friday
**Requirements:**
- Early: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 0 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 0 Nurse (optimal 1)

**Analysis:**
- Patrick: Night shift (5 consecutive), reached maximum - must be off
- Andrea: Late shift (1 consecutive), must continue Late (minimum 2)
- Stefaan: Off (2 consecutive), needs one more day (minimum 3 for PartTime)
- Sara: Off (2 consecutive), needs one more day (minimum 3 for PartTime)
- Nguyen: Has off request - must be off

**Assignments:**
- Off: Nguyen (requested)
- Off: Patrick - after 5 Night shifts
- Off: Stefaan - continues off (day 3)
- Off: Sara - continues off (day 3)
- Early: Andrea (HeadNurse) - VIOLATION! Cannot go from Late to Early

**Correction needed:** Andrea cannot do Early after Late. She must continue Late or be off.

**Revised Friday:**
- Off: Nguyen (requested)
- Off: Patrick - after 5 Night shifts
- Off: Stefaan - continues off (day 3)
- Off: Sara - continues off (day 3)
- Late: Andrea (Nurse) - continues Late (day 2)

**Note:** Missing HeadNurse for Early requirement - 30 penalty. Missing optimal Night nurse - 30 penalty.

### Saturday
**Requirements:**
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

**Analysis:**

- Andrea: Late shift (2 consecutive), working Saturday (weekend consideration)
- Stefaan: Off (3 consecutive), can start working
- Sara: Off (3 consecutive), has Late off request, can do Early or Night
- Nguyen: Has off request - must be off

**Assignments:**
- Off: Nguyen (requested)
- Off: Patrick - continues off (day 2)
- Late: Andrea (HeadNurse) - continues Late (day 3, then must stop)
- Early: Stefaan (Nurse) - starts working
- Night: Sara (Nurse) - starts working (avoiding Late as requested)

### Sunday
**Requirements:**
- Early: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Late: 1 HeadNurse (optimal 1), 1 Nurse (optimal 1)
- Night: 1 Nurse (optimal 1)

**Analysis:**
- Patrick: Off (2 consecutive), must work (reached minimum days off)
- Andrea: Late shift (3 consecutive), reached maximum - must work Sunday for complete weekend
- Stefaan: Early shift (1 consecutive), must work Sunday for complete weekend
- Sara: Night shift (1 consecutive), must work Sunday for complete weekend
- Nguyen: Off (2 consecutive), can continue off or work

**Assignments:**
- Early: Stefaan (Nurse) - continues Early (day 2) and completes weekend
- Late: Patrick (HeadNurse) - starts working
- Late: Andrea (Nurse) - switches to different role to allow Patrick as HeadNurse
- Night: Sara (Nurse) - continues Night (day 2)
- Off: Nguyen - continues off (day 3)

## Final Roster Summary

| Nurse | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Patrick | Night | Night | Night | Night | Off | Off | Late |
| Andrea | Late | Off | Off | Late | Late | Late | Late |
| Stefaan | Early | Early | Off | Off | Off | Early | Early |
| Sara | Late | Late | Late | Off | Off | Night | Night |
| Nguyen | Off | Off | Early | Early | Off | Off | Off |

## Penalty Calculation

1. **Insufficient staffing (Weight: 30):**
   - Wednesday: Missing HeadNurse for Early shift = 30
   - Friday: Missing HeadNurse for Early shift = 30
   - Friday: Missing optimal Night nurse = 30
   - Total: 90

2. **Preferences (Weight: 10):** All requests honored = 0

3. **Complete weekends:** 
   - Andrea: Works Saturday (Late) but changed shift Sunday - needs review
   - Stefaan: Works both days = OK
   - Sara: Works both days = OK
   - Patrick: Works Sunday only = 30 penalty
   - Nguyen: Works neither = OK

Wait, I need to revise Sunday to ensure complete weekends...

**Revised Sunday:**
- Early: Stefaan (Nurse)
- Late: Andrea (HeadNurse) - must continue Late for complete weekend
- Night: Sara (Nurse)
- Late: Nguyen (Nurse) - starts working to meet Late requirement
- Off: Patrick - extends to 3 days off

This creates complete weekend violations. Let me reconsider the entire weekend...
