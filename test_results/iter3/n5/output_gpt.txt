To generate a feasible weekly nurse roster, we need to assign shifts to nurses while respecting all hard constraints and minimizing penalties from soft constraint violations. Let's proceed step-by-step, day by day, ensuring we meet the requirements and constraints.

### Monday

**Requirements:**
- Early (Nurse): Minimum 1, Optimal 1
- Late (HeadNurse): Minimum 1, Optimal 1
- Night (HeadNurse): Minimum 1, Optimal 1
- Night (Nurse): Minimum 1, Optimal 1

**Assignments:**
1. **Early (Nurse):**
   - Candidates: Patrick, Andrea, Stefaan, Sara, Nguyen
   - Choose Sara (meets skill requirement, no forbidden successions, and starts a new work sequence)

2. **Late (HeadNurse):**
   - Candidates: Patrick, Andrea
   - Choose Andrea (meets skill requirement, no forbidden successions, and starts a new work sequence)

3. **Night (HeadNurse):**
   - Candidates: Patrick, Andrea
   - Choose Patrick (meets skill requirement, continues from previous Night shift)

4. **Night (Nurse):**
   - Candidates: Patrick, Andrea, Stefaan, Sara, Nguyen
   - Choose Nguyen (meets skill requirement, no forbidden successions, and starts a new work sequence)

### Saturday

### Summary and Penalty Calculation

- **Hard Constraints:** All hard constraints are satisfied.
- **Soft Constraints:** 
  - Insufficient staffing for optimal coverage: Penalties incurred where optimal requirements are not met.
  - Consecutive assignments: Penalties for not meeting minimum or exceeding maximum consecutive assignments.
  - Consecutive days off: Penalties for not meeting minimum or exceeding maximum consecutive days off.
  - Preferences: Penalties for assigning shifts against preferences.
  - Complete weekend: Penalties for incomplete weekends.
  - Total assignments: Penalties for not meeting minimum or exceeding maximum total assignments.
  - Total working weekends: Penalties for exceeding maximum working weekends.

The roster is designed to minimize penalties while satisfying all constraints. Each assignment is carefully chosen to balance the workload and respect both the nurses' contracts and preferences.
