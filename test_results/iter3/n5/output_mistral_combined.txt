To generate a feasible weekly nurse roster that satisfies all hard constraints and minimizes the total penalty from soft constraint violations, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. Let's break down the process for each day of the week, ensuring we meet all hard constraints first and then minimizing soft constraint violations.

### Step-by-Step Roster Generation

#### Day 1: Monday

1. **Hard Constraints:**
   - **Single assignment per day:** Each nurse can be assigned to at most one shift per day.
   - **Under-staffing:** Meet the minimum requirement for each shift and skill.
   - **Shift type successions:** Ensure legal shift type successions.
   - **Missing required skill:** Assign nurses with the required skills to the shifts.

2. **Soft Constraints:**
   - **Insufficient staffing for optimal coverage (Weight: 30):** Meet the optimal requirement if possible.
   - **Consecutive assignments (Weight: 15/30):** Respect minimum and maximum consecutive assignments.
   - **Consecutive days off (Weight: 30):** Respect minimum and maximum consecutive days off.
   - **Preferences (Weight: 10):** Avoid undesired shifts.
   - **Complete weekend (Weight: 30):** Ensure complete weekends if required.
   - **Total assignments (Weight: 20):** Meet the total number of assignments within contract limits.
   - **Total working weekends (Weight: 30):** Limit the number of working weekends.

##### Monday Requirements:
- **Early (Nurse):** Minimum 1, Optimal 1
- **Late (HeadNurse):** Minimum 1, Optimal 1
- **Late (Nurse):** Minimum 0, Optimal 1
- **Night (HeadNurse):** Minimum 1, Optimal 1
- **Night (Nurse):** Minimum 1, Optimal 1

##### Nurse Availability and Constraints:

- **Andrea:** Last shift Early, 3 consecutive assignments, 3 consecutive working days.
- **Stefaan:** Last shift None, 0 consecutive assignments, 0 consecutive working days.
- **Sara:** Last shift Late, 1 consecutive assignment, 4 consecutive working days.
- **Nguyen:** Last shift None, 0 consecutive assignments, 0 consecutive working days.

##### Assignments:
1. **Early (Nurse):**
   - Options: Sara, Nguyen

   - **Nguyen** has 0 consecutive working days, so assigning him is feasible.
   - **Assignment:** Nguyen to Early (Nurse)

2. **Late (HeadNurse):**
   - Options: Patrick, Andrea, Stefaan
   - **Patrick** has 4 consecutive working days, so assigning him would violate the maximum consecutive working days (5).
   - **Andrea** has 3 consecutive assignments (Early), so assigning her to Late would violate the shift type successions.
   - **Stefaan** has 0 consecutive assignments, so assigning him is feasible.
   - **Assignment:** Stefaan to Late (HeadNurse)

3. **Late (Nurse):**
   - Options: Sara, Nguyen
