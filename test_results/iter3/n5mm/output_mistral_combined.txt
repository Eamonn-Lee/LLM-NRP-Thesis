To generate a feasible weekly nurse roster that satisfies all hard constraints and aims to minimise the total penalty from soft constraint violations, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem Constraints

#### Hard Constraints:
1. **Single Assignment Per Day:** A nurse can only work one shift per day.
2. **Under-Staffing Prevention:** Minimum required nurses per shift and skill must be met.
3. **Shift Type Successions:** Certain shift transitions are forbidden.
4. **Skill Requirements:** Nurses can only be assigned shifts they are qualified for.

#### Soft Constraints:
1. **Optimal Staffing Levels:** Minimize the deviation from the optimal number of nurses required per shift.
2. **Consecutive Working Days:** Minimize violations of the maximum and minimum allowed consecutive working days.
3. **Consecutive Days Off:** Minimize violations of the maximum and minimum allowed consecutive free days.
4. **Shift Preferences:** Minimize violations of shift-off and day-off requests.
5. **Complete Weekend Work Rule:** Minimize violations of the complete weekend work rule.
6. **Total Assignments:** Minimize violations of the maximum and minimum number of shifts a nurse can work.
7. **Total Working Weekends:** Minimize violations of the maximum number of weekends a nurse can work.

### Step 2: Analyze the Given Data

#### Nurses and Their Contracts:
- **Patrick:** FullTime, Skills: HeadNurse, Nurse
- **Andrea:** FullTime, Skills: HeadNurse, Nurse
- **Stefaan:** PartTime, Skills: HeadNurse, Nurse

- **Stefaan:** Last shift: None, Consecutive assignments: 0, Consecutive working days: 0
- **Sara:** Last shift: Late, Consecutive assignments: 1, Consecutive working days: 4
- **Nguyen:** Last shift: None, Consecutive assignments: 0, Consecutive working days: 0

#### Shift Requirements:

- **Total Penalty = 3200**

### Conclusion
